# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data
For this project, I am to provision a Spark cluster on AWS EMR, connect it to a Jupyter Notebook to answer a few questions about the Yelp dataset which is provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) 

The project is divided into 2 parts:

   ## Part A
   1. Create a cluster on AWS EMR, and connect it to a Jupyter Notebook
   2. Upload Yelp dataset to AWS S3
   
   ## Part B
   
   **I. Installation and Initial Setup** Import the necessary dependencies and load Yelp dataset as a pyspark dataframe
   
   **II. Analyzing Categories**
